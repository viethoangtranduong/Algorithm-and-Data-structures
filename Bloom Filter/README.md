1. Give an overview of the types of operations that a Bloom filter supports, and where Bloom filters might be useful.
2. Implement a Bloom filter.
3. Give a description of the hash functions that your implementation uses.
4. Provide an analysis of how your implementation scales in terms of:
4.1. memory size as a function of the false positive rate
4.2. memory size as a function of the number of items stored
4.3. access time as a function of the false positive rate
4.4. access time as a function of the number of items stored
5. Produce a plot to show that your implementationâ€™s false positive rate matches the theoretically expected rate.
6. There are several extensions of Bloom filters, e.g. counting Bloom filters, compressed Bloom filters, Bloomier filters. You may also write an introduction to one of these extensions, instead of a standard Bloom filter.
