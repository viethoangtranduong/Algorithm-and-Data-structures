1. Give an overview of the types of operations that a Bloom filter supports, and where Bloom filters might be useful.
2. Implement a Bloom filter.
3. Give a description of the hash functions that your implementation uses.
4. Provide an analysis of how your implementation scales in terms of:
- memory size as a function of the false positive rate
- memory size as a function of the number of items stored
- access time as a function of the false positive rate
- access time as a function of the number of items stored
5. Produce a plot to show that your implementationâ€™s false positive rate matches the theoretically expected rate.
6. Bloom filter extension: Structured bloom filter.
